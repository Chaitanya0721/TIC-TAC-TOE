Code Explanation: Tic Tac Toe Game
Overview
This Python script is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. Two players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid until one player achieves three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or the game ends in a tie.

Code Breakdown
Initialization:

python code
board = ["_","_","_","_","_","_","_","_","_"]
The board list represents the Tic Tac Toe grid. Initially, all positions are unmarked (_).
Displaying the Board:

python code
def Board():
    print(board[0] + " | " + board[1] + " | " + board[2])
    print(board[3] + " | " + board[4] + " | " + board[5])
    print(board[6] + " | " + board[7] + " | " + board[8])
This function prints the current state of the board in a user-friendly format.
Checking the Result:

python code
def Result(Icon):
    if (board[0] == board[1] == board[2] == Icon) or \
       (board[3] == board[4] == board[5] == Icon) or \
       (board[6] == board[7] == board[8] == Icon) or \
       (board[0] == board[3] == board[6] == Icon) or \
       (board[1] == board[4] == board[7] == Icon) or \
       (board[2] == board[5] == board[8] == Icon) or \
       (board[0] == board[4] == board[8] == Icon) or \
       (board[2] == board[4] == board[6] == Icon):
        print(Icon, "'s Wins")
        sys.exit("Game Over")
    elif "_" in board:
        print("Continue Playing")
    else:
        print("Tie")
        sys.exit()
This function checks if a player has won, if the game is tied, or if it should continue.
Winning conditions are evaluated for all rows, columns, and diagonals.
The game ends with a win message, tie message, or continues playing.
Main Game Logic:

python code
def Play_game():
    Board()
    x = 1
    o = 0
    Turn = 0
    while x > 0:
        if x == o + 1:
            print("It is X's Turn")
            Turn1 = int(input("Enter the position from 1-9: "))
            board[Turn1 - 1] = "X"
            Board()
            x = x + 1
            Result("X")
        else:
            print("It is O's Turn")
            Turn1 = int(input("Enter the position from 1-9: "))
            board[Turn1 - 1] = "O"
            Board()
            o += 1
            Result("O")
Play_game()

Alternates turns between player X and player O.
Players input a position (1-9), which maps to the corresponding index in the board list.
After every move, the board is updated and displayed, and the Result function checks for the game outcome.

How to Run
Save the code in a file, e.g., tic_tac_toe.py.
Run the script in Python:
bash
Copy code
python tic_tac_toe.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to play.

Enhancements
Here are some potential improvements:

Add input validation to prevent overwriting occupied positions or entering invalid indices.
Implement a single-player mode with an AI opponent.
Enhance the user interface with a GUI or web-based front end.
