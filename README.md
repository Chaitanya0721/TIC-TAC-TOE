# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Project Description

The **Tic Tac Toe Game** is a simple two-player console game implemented in Python. Players alternate turns marking positions on a 3x3 grid with either `X` or `O`, aiming to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game automatically checks for a win, tie, or ongoing gameplay after each turn, providing a dynamic and interactive experience.

This project serves as an introduction to basic Python programming concepts like loops, conditionals, list manipulation, and user input handling.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode:** Players take turns to place their symbols (`X` or `O`) on the grid.
- **Win Detection:** Automatically checks for a winner after every move (rows, columns, and diagonals).
- **Tie Detection:** The game recognizes when the board is full without a winner and declares a tie.
- **Dynamic Board Display:** The current game board is displayed after each turn, providing a clear visual of the game state.
- **Easy to Play:** A simple, user-friendly interface in the console that is easy to understand and play.
